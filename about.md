The PhD Virtual Conference is the first virtual conference organized at Bocconi University.
The whole team behind the conference is composed of PhD students in Economics and Finance.

We decided to organize this conference in an effort to overcome the challenges introduced by Covid-19.
The disease disrupted much of our work and work-related travels.
With this conference, all of us who cannot attend regular conferences will still have a chance to discuss their work, receive constructive feedback and meet peers at the same stage of their careers.


## Organizing Committee

The conference organizers are: Giacomo Battiston, Matteo Bizzarri, Daniele D'Arienzo, Riccardo Franceschin, Ekaterina Gavrilova and Andrea Pasqualini.


## Scientific Committee

The scientific committee is split across the three tracks of the conference.
The heads for each branch of the committee are:
