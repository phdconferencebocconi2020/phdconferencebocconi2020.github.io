`[meglio "organization" and not logistics]`


## Talk

Each talk is split as follows.

- 30 minutes presentation
- 15 minutes discussion

Each presenter should target a 20-minutes talk, so to allow for a short Q&A session between the presentation and the discussion.


## Agenda

We expect participants from all over the world, but we are based in Milan and we follow the CEST time zone.
To ease the challenge of different time zones, we will try to accommodate talks. 
You will not have to present your paper in the middle of the night!

## Tools

We will use `[tool]` to conduct the conference.
Presenters will share their screens with their slides, while session chairs will manage the virtual room.
Questions—if any—will be written in a Q&A section and the chair will pass them up to the presenter.
Alternatively, questions can be asked by requesting the chair to have your microphone unmuted via a "Raise hand" button.
